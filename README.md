# Psychometric-Scale-Construction-with-EFA-CFA-and-Item-Analysis
This repository contains a full R-based workflow for developing and validating a psychological scale. It walks through the process from raw item responses to a theoretically sound and statistically valid factor structure.
---
## üéØ Objectives
- To screen and analyze individual items
- To explore the underlying factor structure using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
- To confirm the structure with Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
- To ensure the scale‚Äôs psychometric soundness via reliability and model fit indices

## üß† Contents
The procedure follows a classical test theory approach:

### Part 1: Item Analysis & EFA
1. **Data Preparation**  
   Import and clean raw data; focus on items X1 to X28.
2. **Normality Check**  
   Evaluate skewness and kurtosis to confirm item-level normality.
3. **Score Construction**  
   Compute total and average scores across items.
4. **Group Splitting**  
   Split participants into high/low score groups.
5. **Independent Sample t-tests**  
   Evaluate item discrimination between groups.
6. **Missing Values & Descriptive Statistics**  
   Report item-level means and check scale range.
7. **Suitability for Factor Analysis**  
   Use KMO and Bartlett‚Äôs test to check assumptions.
8. **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)**  
   Run parallel analysis, determine factor count, remove problematic items.
9. **Internal Consistency**  
   Calculate Cronbach‚Äôs alpha for each factor.

### Part 2: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
1. **Model Comparison**  
   Iteratively test models (Model 1‚ÄìModel 6) using fit indices: CFI, RMSEA, SRMR, Chi-square.
2. **Final Model Selection**  
   Present the best-fitting CFA model.
3. **Path Diagram Visualization**  
   Plot the final CFA model structure.
